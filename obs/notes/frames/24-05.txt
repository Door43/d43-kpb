===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He is so great** - This could be translated as, "He is so important."
  * **not even worthy to untie his sandals** - In other words, "compared to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task for him." Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave would do.
